<p>I crave learning even <i>more</i> than I crave donuts. In case you don't know me, thats a lot! Having developed a strong management foundation in the retail field, I found myself yearning for a career change, and a field that would challenge me EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. What better way than a Code Immersion Program, you say? Well, I'd say youre right. I dove in to Tech Talent South's bootcamp and my mind hasnt slowed down since. I am looking for my next opportunity that can combine my natural abilities with the new skills I have learned and continue to learn, and can make me feel like a true asset to this world. Any Ideas? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devan-palmer-6a5a6711b"><u>Lets Connect!</u></a></p>

 	<h3>Past:</h3><br><a href="http://www.cleanclothesavl.com/"><u><center>CLEAN CLOTHES FOR ASHEVILLE</u></a><p><br>An incredible foundation that provides laundering services and hygenic supplies for the homeless so that they have support in getting back on their feet. I was commisioned to make a basic website that would give an overview, provide a point of contact for the program administrators, and accept donations. Being a cause I believe in, this project was a no brainer.</p>

 	<h3>Past:</h3><br><a href="http://www.houseofcaviar.co/"><u><center>HOUSE OF CAVIAR</u></a><p><br>Excuisitely made clothing tailored for the classically stylish, collaborating on this site was a pleasure. I was hired to transfer outdated Adobe files to a media responsive, SEO friendly website. Unfortunately, the original designer went out of business in the middle of the project, and I was unable to get the final product uploaded, my source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/palmer1339/houseofcaviar"><u>Github</u>.</a></p>

 	<h4>Present:</h4><a><center><u>RANARD BROWN</u></a>
 	<p><br>Ranard is a true innovator and entrepreneur that I have been lucky to have as a mentor. Currently contracted on his personal website, it is a huge undertaking that has been both challenging and fun. I am currently building on WordPress, and creating and managing this website end-to-end. The details that will make a stakeholder smile is my favorite part of development, and tapping into the websites unique personality is a skill in which I pride myself.<br><br></p>

	<h4>Future:</h4><a><center><u>DEVAN PALMER</u></a>
 	<p><br>The journey that life has led me on so far has exceeded my dreams and expectations so much that I can't begin to predict the future. What I do know is that I will always be a learner, and continually strive to build upon the knowledge that I have been given. My current side projects include; an app to better connect law enforcement with citizens and victims, a casino style game with an exciting twist, and a new twist on the dating scene (pretend you havent read that 1,000 times). Whatever the future holds, you will find me embracing it with open arms.<br><br></p></div>
